# Publishing and Citing Datasets

Guidelines for making datasets publicly available, creating DOIs, and properly citing datasets.

## Purpose

This guideline supports Data Systems workflows by ensuring datasets referenced in publications are
openly accessible, properly identified with DOIs, and cited according to community standards. It
aligns with publisher and funder policies and promotes scientific reproducibility.

## How to Publish and Cite Datasets

**Make Data Open and Accessible**
   Ensure datasets associated with publications are stored in publicly accessible, machine-readable formats.

**Create a DOI and Landing Page**
   Digital Object Identifiers, DOIs, are machine-readable identifiers that resolve to information about a resource.
   In addition to datasets, researchers can have an ORCID digital identifier, see https://orcid.org/. Publishers are
   now generally requiring DOIs that point to data referenced publications, and often ORCIDs as well.
   - See [Digital Object Identifiers](digital_object_identifiers.md) for an introduction to DOIs.
   - See [Creating a DOI via CU Libraries and DataCite](creating_a_doi.md) for a quick start on creating a DOI and a
     landing page for a dataset.
   - LASP could build resources to create and manage DOIs and associated landing pages.

**Cite Datasets in Publications**
   Follow established data citation principles to ensure datasets are properly cited in scholarly works. Reference
   the [Force 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles](https://www.force11.org/datacitationprinciples) and
   follow practices described in the [ESIP Dataset Citation Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8441816).

**Understand Publisher Requirements**
   Ensure that DOIs and ORCIDs are included as required by publishers to maintain compliance with submission guidelines.

## Options

There are several options for publishing datasets:

1. **CU Libraries and DataCite DOI Creation**
   Researchers can create DOIs and landing pages for datasets using CU Libraries' integration with DataCite.

2. **CU Scholar Hosting**
   CU Scholar can host articles, reports, and datasets of limited size. CU Scholar prefers to generate and manage DOIs
   for hosted datasets.

3. **LASP DOI Management (Future Direction)**
   LASP can develop internal resources for creating and managing DOIs and dataset landing pages, streamlining the
   process for LASP-affiliated data products.

4. **External Repositories**
   For larger datasets or specialized data types, external repositories that support DOI assignment can be considered.
